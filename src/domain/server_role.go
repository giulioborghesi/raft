// three roles: follower, candidate and leader. Each role implements a distinct
// behavior for the following endpoints: requestVote, appendEntry and
// startElection
type serverRole interface {
	// appendEntry implements the logic used to determine whether a server
	// should append a log entry sent by the current leader to its log

	// should grant its vote to an external server for the current term
